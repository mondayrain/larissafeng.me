  <p>It’s that time of the year again!<br /></p>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>

<p><strong>If you donate to a charity of my choosing before May 31, I’ll match your donation at 50%.</strong></p>

<p>I’ll keep a live status update (with total donations, # donors, etc) <a href="https://larissafeng.me/birthday_campaign_status">here</a>.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="what-is-this-campaign">What (is this campaign)?</h2>

<p>Each year as my birthday is upcoming, I ask my friends &amp; family to <strong>consider donating to a charity/non-profit organization of my choosing</strong> in place of buying me a present. I’m extremely fortunate to have people in my life who are willing to spend the money to do so, but your time and company are enough! It would make me infinitely happier to see that $$ go to supporting people &amp; causes that I believe are important.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="how-does-it-work">How (does it work)?</h2>

<p><strong>Every year, the “rules” are the same</strong>:</p>

<p>1) Choose one of the charities/non-profit organizations listed below (under “Who?”)</p>

<p>2) Make a donation (of any amount) to them, and <em>make sure to get the receipt!</em> (you can claim them on your taxes!)</p>

<p>3) Email me the receipt at <a href="mailto:hello@larissafeng.me">hello@larissafeng.me</a></p>

<p>4) <strong>I will match 50% of your donation</strong>, to a limit of $1000 in matching overall</p>

<p>In 2017, we donated $2949.04 in total. Last year, we topped that with $3052.78. I’m stoked to see if we can top last year!</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="when-will-this-go-until">When (will this go until)?</h2>

<p><strong>I’ll be collecting receipts &amp; matching donations until May 31</strong>.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="where-do-i-donate">Where (do I donate)?</h2>
<p><a href="##what?">anchor</a></p>

<p><em><strong>I put a of thought into effective giving, and consequently the organizations I choose</strong></em>. My choices have historically been strongly informed by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism#Criticism">Effective Altruism</a> movement and still are, although you’ll see from the list that I am starting to deviate from their recommendations. If you’re interested in why, please ping me sometime for a discussion :)</p>

<p><em><strong>There is surefire way to choosing a charity</strong></em>, and there are almost always reasons both <em>to</em> donate, and <em>not to</em> donate to them. I’ve included any of my notes below.</p>

<p><br /><strong>The Malaria Consortium</strong>
<br />Preventing Malaria
<br /><a href="https://www.malariaconsortium.org/">https://www.malariaconsortium.org/</a></p>

<p>Preventing malaria is important and tractable, but <em>unfortunately neglected for how cost-effective the solutions can be</em>.</p>

<p>Each year, more than one million cases of Malaria result in death. Of those deaths, 70% of them occur to children under 5. The Malaria Consortium works on preventing, controlling, &amp; treating Malaria in Africa &amp; Asia, running interventions such as their <a href="https://www.who.int/malaria/areas/preventive_therapies/children/en/">seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC)</a> program. <em>SMC has been shown to be 75% protective against uncomplicated and severe malaria in children under 5 years of age, &amp; is extremely cost effective</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Why donate?</strong></em>: There aren’t many initiatives as cost-effective as preventing Malaria when it comes to preventing death. The Malaria Consortium in particular has been vetted <a href="https://www.givewell.org/charities/malaria-consortium">quite thoroughly by GiveWell</a>.</p>

<p><em><strong>Why not donate?</strong></em>: In short, drug resistance is a problem. <a href="https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2019/01/04/givewell-top-charities-explained-malaria-consortium/">See here</a>.</p>

<p><br /><strong>Freedom Fund</strong>
<br />Combatting Modern Slavery
<br /><a href="https://freedomfund.org/">https://freedomfund.org/</a></p>

<p><em><strong>Modern slavery - also known as “human trafficking” - is alive and well</strong></em>. 21 to 45 million people are trapped in some form of slavery today, whether it be sex trafficking, bonded labour, child labour, or domestic servitude. The Freedom Fund is tries to identify &amp; partner with frontline organisations to directly combat slavery in defined regions where it is highly concentrated. They do this through setting up “hotspot” projects – clusters of the most effective community-based organisations – as well as engaging the government, working in the private sector, and running media initiatives.</p>

<p>You can learn more about modern slavery <a href="https://www.endslaverynow.org/learn/slavery-today">here</a>.</p>

<p><em><strong>Why donate?</strong></em>: Human trafficking is a horrible and complicated issue stemming from poverty, racism, sexism, &amp; a whole other slew of things. The Freedom Fund works only with community-based organizations, which has been shown to be one of the most effective ways to achieve large-scale and sustainable impact.</p>

<p><em><strong>Why not donate?</strong></em>: Since poverty &amp; its associated effects seem to fuel trafficking and slavery, it may be more effective to instead focus on mitigating the socioeconomic conditions in which these problems thrive.</p>

<p><br /><strong>Cool Earth</strong>
<br />Climate Change (through reforestation)
<br /><a href="https://www.coolearth.org/">https://www.coolearth.org/</a></p>

<p>Half of the world’s rainforest has been lost over the past forty years. This is a shame, because the rainforest sequesters a massive amount of the world’s carbon. In fact, <em><strong>deforestation has been responsible for more CO2 in the atmosphere than all of the world’s transport combined</strong></em>.</p>

<p>Given that, keeping rainforest standing is probably one of the simplest and cheapest ways to mitigate climate change. Despite this, we are destroying the world’s rainforest at a faster rate than ever.</p>

<p>Cool Earth partners with rainforest communities to improve their quality of life &amp; economic situations, which enables them to product their surrounding forests from threats such as commercial logging, commercial agriculture and extractive industries. They do this by building livelihoods that ensure that communities earn more from keeping the forest standing than they would otherwise from clearing it.</p>

<p><em><strong>Why donate?</strong></em>: Cool Earth puts people first and creates partnerships that become self-sufficient, and not depending on Cool Earth. This is a sustainable model, and puts people first <em>while</em> combatting climate change.</p>

<p><em><strong>Why not donate?</strong></em>: You don’t think that reforestation is going to help climate change, or that it will make enough of a difference to matter.</p>

<p><br /><strong>Lake Ontario Waterkeeper</strong>
<br />(Local) Environment
<br /><a href="http://www.waterkeeper.ca/">http://www.waterkeeper.ca/</a></p>

<p>Unfortunately, our local bodies of water need our help staying clean (or rather, <a href="https://www.swimdrinkfish.ca/">swimmable, drinkable, &amp; fishable</a> and dealing with all the pollution that we create. For example, in 2013 there were 3,024 beach advisories on Lake Ontario. These water quality advisories cost Ontario more than $250-million in lost economic value and contributed to an estimated 78,000 waterborne illnesses.</p>

<p>Lake Ontario Waterkeeper’s mission is to help communities protect swimmable, drinkable, fishable water. They promote water literacy, and investigate threats to the watershed and participate in fact-based processes like license reviews, environmental assessments, and legal hearings.</p>

<p><em><strong>Why donate?</strong></em>: Take care of the Great Lakes, and the Great Lakes will take care of you - Marina S, esteemed environmentalist.</p>

<p><em><strong>Why not donate?</strong></em>: It’s quite a local organization, and therefore may have limited impact.</p>

<p><br /><strong>Electronic Frontier Foundation</strong>
<br />(Digital) Civil Liberties
<br /><a href="https://www.eff.org/">https://www.eff.org/</a></p>

<p>We are all citizens, and therefore we are all impacted when our civil liberties are infringed upon. Although it’s not often discussed, <em><strong>there are many ways in which our digital lives (which are increasingly just our lives) have been suffering from loss of free speech and privacy</strong></em>.</p>

<p>The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) champions user privacy, free expression, and innovation. They engage in major legislative fights, beating back digital censorship bills disguised as intellectual property proposals, opposing attempts to force companies to spy on users, and championing reform bills that rein in government surveillance.</p>

<p><em><strong>Why donate?</strong></em>: The EFF has been in the trenches for many important events in digital civil liberties, such as the SOPA web blackout. They also have a great reputation and have built lovely tools that developers love, such as Certbot.</p>

<p><em><strong>Why not donate?</strong></em>: You think privacy is dead, or don’t think much about digital intellectual property rights.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="why-should-i-do-this">Why (should I do this)?</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, that’s a question only you can answer for yourself. :)</p>

<p>Personally, I (like many people) crave the satisfaction of knowing that I at least <em>tried</em> to make the world a better place. I’ve enjoyed a very privileged life, and since I try to apply the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veil_of_ignorance">veil of ignorance</a> as much as I can, I feel strongly about trying to help others enjoy the same. It often feels like an insurmountable task, and that my contributions mean nothing, but as David Mitchell said:</p>

<p><strong>“My life amounts to no more than one drop in a limitless ocean. Yet what is any ocean, but a multitude of drops?”</strong></p>
