title:  2019 Birthday Campaign
---

It's that time of the year again!<br>

<br>
## TL;DR

**If you donate to a charity of my choosing before May 31** (and send me the receipt at [hello@larissafeng.me](mailto:hello@larissafeng.me)), **I'll match 50% of your donation.**

I'll keep a live status update (with total donations, # donors, etc) [here](https://larissafeng.me/birthday_campaign_status).

<br>
## What (is this campaign)?

Each year as my birthday is upcoming, I ask my friends & family to **consider donating to a charity/non-profit organization of my choosing** in place of buying me a present. I'm extremely fortunate to have people in my life who are willing to spend the money to do so, but your time and company are enough! It would make me infinitely happier to see that $$ go to supporting people & causes that I believe are important.

<br>
## How (does it work)?

**Every year, the "rules" are the same**:

1) Choose one of the charities/non-profit organizations listed below

2) Make a donation (of any amount) to them, and _make sure to get the receipt!_ (you can claim them on your taxes!)

3) Email me the receipt at [hello@larissafeng.me](mailto:hello@larissafeng.me)

4) **I will match 50% of your donation**, to a limit of $1200 in total matching overall

In 2017, we donated $2949.04 in total. Last year, we topped that with $3052.78. I'm stoked to see if we can top last year!

<br>
## When (will this go until)?


**I'll be collecting receipts & matching donations until May 31**.

<br>
## Where (do I donate)?

_**I put a fair amount of thought into how best to give, and consequently the organizations I choose**_. My choices have historically been strongly informed by the [Effective Altruism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism) movement and still are, although you'll see from the list that I am starting to deviate from their recommendations. If you're interested in why, please ping me sometime for a discussion :)

_**There is no perfect charity/non-profit**_, and there are almost always reasons both _to_ donate, and _not to_ donate to one. I've included any of my notes below.

<br>**The Malaria Consortium**
<br>Preventing Malaria
<br>[https://www.malariaconsortium.org](https://www.malariaconsortium.org/)

Preventing malaria is important and tractable, but *unfortunately neglected for how cost-effective the solutions can be*.

Each year, more than one million cases of Malaria result in death. Of those deaths, 70% of them occur to children under 5. The Malaria Consortium works on preventing, controlling, & treating Malaria in Africa & Asia, running interventions such as their [seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC)](https://www.who.int/malaria/areas/preventive_therapies/children/en/) program. _SMC has been shown to be 75% protective against uncomplicated and severe malaria in children under 5 years of age, & is extremely cost effective_.

_**Why donate?**_ There aren't many initiatives as cost-effective as preventing Malaria when it comes to preventing death. The Malaria Consortium in particular has been vetted [quite thoroughly by GiveWell](https://www.givewell.org/charities/malaria-consortium).

_**Why not donate?**_ In short, surveys can be hard & drug resistance is a problem. [See here](https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2019/01/04/givewell-top-charities-explained-malaria-consortium/) for more.

<br>**Freedom Fund**
<br>Modern Slavery / Human Trafficking
<br>[https://freedomfund.org](https://freedomfund.org/)

_**Modern slavery - also known as "human trafficking" - is alive and well**_. 21 to 45 million people are trapped in some form of slavery today, whether it be sex trafficking, bonded labour, child labour, or domestic servitude. The Freedom Fund tries to identify & partner with frontline organisations to directly combat slavery in defined regions where it is highly concentrated. They do this through setting up “hotspot” projects – clusters of community-based organisations – as well as engaging the government, working in the private sector, and running media initiatives. 

You can learn more about modern slavery [here](https://www.endslaverynow.org/learn/slavery-today).

_**Why donate?**_ Human trafficking is a horrible and complicated issue stemming from poverty, racism, sexism, & a whole other slew of things. The Freedom Fund works only with community-based organizations, and requires rigorous monitoring & metrics so that they can better see what works and enforce accountability.

_**Why not donate?**_ Since poverty & its associated effects seem to fuel trafficking and slavery, it may be more effective to just focus on mitigating the socioeconomic conditions in which these problems thrive instead.

<br>**Cool Earth**
<br>Climate Change (through reforestation)
<br>[https://www.coolearth.org](https://www.coolearth.org/)

Half of the world’s rainforest has been lost over the past forty years. This is a shame, because the rainforest sequesters a massive amount of the world's carbon. In fact, _**deforestation has been responsible for more CO2 in the atmosphere than all of the world’s transport combined**_.

Given that, keeping rainforest standing is probably one of the simplest and cheapest ways to mitigate climate change. Despite this, we are destroying the world’s rainforest at a faster rate than ever.

Cool Earth partners with rainforest communities to improve their quality of life & economic situations, which enables them to protect their surrounding forests from threats such as commercial logging, commercial agriculture and extractive industries. They do this by building livelihoods that ensure that communities earn more from keeping the forest standing than they would otherwise from clearing it.

_**Why donate?**_ Climate change will and is already affecting everyone on this planet. Cool Earth not only tries to address this issue in a focused (and measurable) way, but they also put people first and create partnerships that become self-sufficient. This is a sustainable model, and puts people first _while_ combatting climate change.

_**Why not donate?**_ You don't think that reforestation is going to help climate change, or that it will make enough of a difference to matter.

<br>**Lake Ontario Waterkeeper**
<br>(Local) Environment
<br>[http://www.waterkeeper.ca](http://www.waterkeeper.ca/)

Unfortunately, our local bodies of water need our help staying clean and dealing with all the pollution that we create. For example, in 2013 there were 3,024 beach advisories on Lake Ontario. These water quality advisories cost Ontario more than $250-million in lost economic value and contributed to an estimated 78,000 waterborne illnesses.

Lake Ontario Waterkeeper’s mission is to help communities protect [swimmable, drinkable, & fishable](https://www.swimdrinkfish.ca/our-vision) water. They promote water literacy, investigate threats to the watershed, and participate in fact-based processes like legal hearings, license reviews, & environmental assessments. 

_**Why donate?**_ Take care of the Great Lakes, and the Great Lakes will take care of you - Marina S, esteemed environmentalist (also, Ontario really does rely on the Great Lakes for a lot of things).

_**Why not donate?**_ It's quite a local organization, and therefore may have limited impact. 

<br>**Electronic Frontier Foundation**
<br>(Digital) Civil Liberties
<br>[https://www.eff.org](https://www.eff.org/)

We are all digital citizens, and therefore we are all impacted when our digital civil liberties are infringed upon. Although it's not often discussed, _**there are many ways in which our digital lives (which are increasingly just our lives) have been suffering from loss of free speech and privacy**_.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) champions user privacy, free expression, and innovation. They do this by engaging in major legislative fights, beating back digital censorship bills disguised as intellectual property proposals, opposing attempts to force companies to spy on users, and championing reform bills that rein in government surveillance.

_**Why donate?**_ If you think you [have nothing to hide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_to_hide_argument), [you may want to reconsider](https://vimeo.com/nothingtohide). Also, the EFF has been in the trenches for many important events in digital civil liberties, such as the US SOPA web blackout. They also have a great reputation and have built lovely tools that developers know & love, such as [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/).

_**Why not donate?**_ You think privacy is dead, or don't think much about digital intellectual property rights.

<br>
## Why (should I do this)?

If you are currently facing financial hardship, then of course, you probably shouldn't! But if you are quite comfortable, then that's a question only you can answer for yourself. :)

Personally, I (like many people) crave the satisfaction of knowing that I at least _tried_ to make the world a better place. I've enjoyed a very privileged life, and since I try to apply the [veil of ignorance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veil_of_ignorance) as much as I can, I feel strongly about trying to help others enjoy the same. It often feels like an insurmountable task, and that my contributions mean nothing. But as David Mitchell wrote:

**“My life amounts to no more than one drop in a limitless ocean. Yet what is any ocean, but a multitude of drops?”**
